            <p class="Rockstar">When I was younger, I saw videos on GTA V which was one of the games this company made. The videos I saw of the game was just some guy exploring the sewers, the deep sea, and swamps to find hidden secrets and cool stuff. I thought that was really cool and I thought that this game was just an open-world sandbox game where I could do whatever stupid act I wanted whenever I wanted. Even when I went to my cousin's house a few years ago and I saw that he had GTA V on his console, I asked him if I can play it. He just told me that I was too young to play a game like that.<br> Then last year, the game was free for a while and I decided to get it because why not?. Now I understand why my cousin didn't want me to play the game. This was when I was just starting to play games for a more older audience. At first, I played the game to just goof off. I remember trying to get a blimp that was free for some reason and attempting to land it in front of a tiny house I had in a neighborhood. It crashed. Eventually I got bored of messing around and didn't play it for a while. <br>Then I eventually got back into the game and actually started to like it. The story was really good and it was the best story I've seen in a videogame for a long time. My only gripes about the game was that the combat was odd, and the world felt very empty.<br> But then about half a year later, I decided to get another game they made called red dead redemption 2 because it was an expensive game that was on sale. I loved this game. It had an amazing story I still think about a month later. even though it had the same odd combat, I actually liked it more because there were more instances where I actually had to use it. The game looked very beautiful and there was actually stuff to find if I explored the world. I will definately remember this game company for the stories they make.</p>

              <p class="Warhorse">I don't remember how I found this game studio,but I'm glad I did. The story in their game was really good but not as good as Rockstar. But what really got me sold on this game was the very difficult combat, and roleplaying elements.This game was called Kingdom come deliverance.<br> I really liked the difficult combat in the game. It really made very encounter with an enemy more scary because it would always at least be somewhat challenging. Even if I have all the best stuff in the game, if a huge mob of farmers charge at me with pitchforks would still terrify me whereas in a game like skyrim, I could beat them in a blink of an eye. <br>Another thing I really liked about the game was that it had me make choices and the choices I made would affect what would happen and what I would be able to do in the game. I would hear about 2 questlines that people who played the game will talk about. In 2 playthroughs I missed both of them because I failed to do something before which I really liked. I will definately remember this game because of it's sword fighting and RPG elements.</p>    <a href="https://press.warhorsestudios.cz/warhorse-studios/">a little more info about Warhorse studios</a><hr>

          <p class="bio">Bethesda is a video game industry in the US state of Maryland. It was founded by Christopher Weaver. &copy;</p>
            <p class="Bethesda">I liked the games made by Bethesda. I tried Skyrim because it was on sale for 18 bucks and at first I hated it. looking around was painful because the field of view was super zoomed in and the graphics weren't great. Not as great as other games I played. But as soon as I found out how to chnage the FOV and install mods, I really started to play it. My only gripe was the combat was very basic and got very boring. This was especially bad because I played Kingdom come before this game and that game's combat was super fun and challenging. Then I tried Fallout 4 becuase it was on sale for 9 dollars. Fallout 4 to me was basically Metro Exodus which was the name of another game I really liked but with a lot more content.<br>Something I really like about how Bethesda makes their games is that they fill their worlds to the brim with places to go. Every time I would have to go somewhere for a mission, I would get distracted by so many places to go. I would arrive at my original destination at least an hour later. I will definately remember this studio because of the worlds they make.</p>
